# Terraform State Lock Management

## Overview

This document describes the automated state lock management system implemented to prevent and recover from Terraform state locks that can occur during CI/CD pipeline failures.

## Problem Statement

Terraform uses state locking to prevent concurrent modifications. When a Terraform operation (plan/apply) is interrupted (e.g., CI timeout, manual cancellation, network failure), the lock may not be released properly, blocking all subsequent operations with errors like:

```
Error: Error acquiring the state lock
Lock Info:
  ID:        0d2cb69e-f9fd-7ed5-3571-09bf08c827e1
  Operation: OperationTypeApply
  Who:       pmcgee@dash-midnight.local
  Created:   2025-10-03 14:47:06.994532 +0000 UTC
```

## Solution: 3-Layer Defense

### 1. **Prevention** (Future Enhancement)

- Set appropriate timeouts in deploy-layers.sh
- Implement graceful shutdown handlers
- Use workflow timeout limits

### 2. **Detection** (Automated)

Checks for stale locks before every operation:

- **Pre-Plan**: Check for locks older than 30 minutes
- **Pre-Apply**: Check for locks older than 15 minutes (more aggressive)

### 3. **Recovery** (Automated)

Automatically unlocks stale locks with safety checks:

- **Post-Failure**: Force unlock immediately after failed operations
- **Safety validation**: Checks lock age and ownership before unlocking
- **Audit trail**: Logs all lock operations

## Implementation

### Script: `unlock-stale-locks.sh`

**Location**: `terraform/ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh`

**Usage**:

```bash
# Check all layers for locks older than 30 minutes
./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh staging "" 30

# Check specific layer
./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh staging 01-foundation 30

# Force unlock (bypasses safety checks)
FORCE_UNLOCK=true ./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh staging "" 0
```

**Parameters**:

1. `ENVIRONMENT` - staging, prod, etc.
2. `LAYER` - Specific layer (empty for all layers)
3. `MAX_LOCK_AGE_MINUTES` - Consider locks older than this stale

**Safety Features**:

- ‚úÖ Age-based validation (don't unlock recent locks)
- ‚úÖ Ownership check (don't unlock other users' locks by default)
- ‚úÖ Force option for CI automation (`FORCE_UNLOCK=true`)
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging of all operations

### GitHub Actions Integration

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/terraform-infrastructure.yml`

#### Added Steps:

**1. Pre-Plan Lock Check** (Line ~294):

```yaml
- name: Check and Clear Stale Locks (Pre-Plan)
  run: |
    cd terraform
    chmod +x ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh
    ./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh ${ENVIRONMENT} "" 30 || {
      echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Could not check/clear all locks, proceeding anyway..."
    }
```

**2. Post-Plan Failure Cleanup** (Line ~331):

```yaml
- name: Cleanup Locks on Failure (Post-Plan)
  if: failure() && steps.tf-plan.conclusion == 'failure'
  run: |
    cd terraform
    echo "::warning::Terraform plan failed - attempting to cleanup any locks..."
    chmod +x ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh
    FORCE_UNLOCK=true ./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh ${ENVIRONMENT} "" 0 || true
```

**3. Pre-Apply Lock Check** (Line ~436):

```yaml
- name: Check and Clear Stale Locks (Pre-Apply)
  run: |
    cd terraform
    chmod +x ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh
    # More aggressive - clear locks older than 15 minutes
    ./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh ${ENVIRONMENT} "" 15 || {
      echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Could not check/clear all locks, proceeding anyway..."
    }
```

**4. Post-Apply Failure Cleanup** (Line ~458):

```yaml
- name: Cleanup Locks on Failure (Post-Apply)
  if: failure() && steps.tf-apply.conclusion == 'failure'
  run: |
    cd terraform
    echo "::error::Terraform apply failed - cleaning up locks..."
    chmod +x ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh
    FORCE_UNLOCK=true ./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh ${ENVIRONMENT} "" 0 || true
```

## Workflow Behavior

### Normal Operation (No Locks)

```
Plan Phase:
  1. Check for stale locks ‚Üí ‚úì None found
  2. Run terraform plan ‚Üí ‚úì Success
  3. Continue workflow

Apply Phase:
  1. Check for stale locks ‚Üí ‚úì None found
  2. Run terraform apply ‚Üí ‚úì Success
  3. Complete workflow
```

### Recovery from Failed Run

```
Plan Phase (After Previous Failure):
  1. Check for stale locks ‚Üí üîí Found lock from 45 minutes ago
  2. Unlock stale lock ‚Üí ‚úì Unlocked
  3. Run terraform plan ‚Üí ‚úì Success
  4. Continue workflow

Apply Phase:
  1. Check for stale locks ‚Üí ‚úì None found (cleaned in plan)
  2. Run terraform apply ‚Üí ‚úì Success
  3. Complete workflow
```

### Handling New Failure

```
Plan Phase:
  1. Check for stale locks ‚Üí ‚úì None found
  2. Run terraform plan ‚Üí ‚ùå FAILED
  3. Cleanup locks ‚Üí ‚úì Force unlocked
  4. Workflow fails (but locks are cleaned)

Next Run:
  1. Check for stale locks ‚Üí ‚úì None found (cleaned by previous run)
  2. Run terraform plan ‚Üí ‚úì Can proceed
```

## Local Usage

### Check for locks manually:

```bash
cd terraform
./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh staging
```

### Force unlock specific layer:

```bash
cd terraform
FORCE_UNLOCK=true ./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh staging 04-compute 0
```

### Check single layer:

```bash
cd terraform
./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh staging 01-foundation 30
```

## Manual Override (Emergency)

If automated unlock fails, you can manually unlock:

```bash
cd terraform/04-compute
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
```

Or use AWS CLI to delete from DynamoDB:

```bash
aws dynamodb delete-item \
  --table-name astro-data-pipeline-terraform-lock-staging \
  --key '{"LockID":{"S":"<state-file-path>-md5"}}'
```

## Lock Age Thresholds

| Context | Threshold | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| CI Pre-Plan | 30 minutes | Conservative - allows long-running plans |
| CI Pre-Apply | 15 minutes | Aggressive - applies are typically faster |
| CI Post-Failure | 0 minutes | Emergency - clean up immediately |
| Local Usage | 30 minutes | Default safe value for manual operations |

## Monitoring

The workflow will output warnings/errors in GitHub Actions:

- `‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Could not check/clear all locks` - Non-fatal, continues
- `üîí Lock detected in layer/environment` - Informational
- `‚úÖ Successfully unlocked layer/environment` - Success
- `‚ùå Failed to unlock layer/environment` - Requires manual intervention

## Safety Considerations

1. **Owner validation**: Won't unlock other users' locks unless `FORCE_UNLOCK=true`
2. **Age validation**: Won't unlock recent locks (respects MAX_LOCK_AGE_MINUTES)
3. **CI context**: In CI, FORCE_UNLOCK is automatically set for post-failure cleanup
4. **Audit trail**: All lock operations are logged

## Future Enhancements

1. **Slack/Email notifications** when locks are auto-unlocked
2. **Metrics collection** - track lock frequency and duration
3. **Lock timeout in Terraform** - Set `-lock-timeout` parameter
4. **Workflow timeouts** - Add overall job timeouts
5. **Lock monitoring dashboard** - Visualize lock patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Locks still present after auto-cleanup

```bash
# Check lock details
cd terraform/04-compute
terraform plan -lock-timeout=1s 2>&1 | grep -A10 "Lock Info"

# Force unlock manually
FORCE_UNLOCK=true ./ci/unlock-stale-locks.sh staging 04-compute 0
```

### Script can't access backend

```bash
# Reinitialize Terraform
cd terraform/04-compute
terraform init
```

### Permission errors in CI

- Ensure the AWS role has DynamoDB permissions for the lock table
- Check that the workflow has `id-token: write` permissions
