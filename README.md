# Astronomical Data Processing Pipeline

An astronomical image calibration pipeline designed for the Roman Space Telescope mission, featuring 
cloud-native data processing.

## 🌟 Overview

This project implements an astronomical data processing system that:
- Processes raw telescope images (FITS files) through a calibration pipeline
- Does dark frame subtraction, flat field correction, and cosmic ray removal
- Generates astronomical object catalogs from processed images
- Runs on AWS cloud infrastructure with Kubernetes orchestration
- Uses Apache Airflow for workflow management

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot microservices
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow with Kubernetes Executor  
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (EKS, RDS, S3) managed via Terraform
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL + S3 data lake architecture
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated deployment

### Processing Pipeline
```
Raw FITS Files → Dark Subtraction → Flat Correction → Cosmic Ray Removal → Image Stacking → Catalog Generation
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Terraform >= 1.0
- kubectl configured for EKS access
- Java 17+ and Gradle for local development

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd astro-data-pipeline

# Start local services
docker-compose up -d

# Build Java services
cd application
./gradlew build

# Run tests
./gradlew test
```

### AWS Deployment
```bash
# Deploy infrastructure
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="production.tfvars"

# Deploy applications
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/
```
